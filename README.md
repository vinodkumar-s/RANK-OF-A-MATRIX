# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: We have imported numpy which is needed. 
### Step 2: We have created a matrix by using np.array with different values in it. 
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: Finally, print the value of the rank of the matrix.


## Program:
## program to find the rank of a matrix.

```python
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]])
rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(rank)


```

## OUTPUT:
